# InfoRe COC - Automation Toolkit for Clash of Clans

*By InfoRe Inc., Viet Nam*

This tool aims to provide a remotely controlled automation system for Clash of Clans. The currently supported running environment is Linux due to some limitation of inter-process communication on Windows. This tool is written in Python.

A sample configuration should contains,

* Some virtual Android machines for running Clash of Clans.
* A virtual Linux machine for running InfoReCoC with at least a network interface which is located in the same network segment with above Android machines.
* A executable version of ADB toolkit (`adb` only), which should be defaultly located at /usr/local/bin.

*I will update this guide later if I have free time*
